<img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="frontpagerounded.png">

Welcome to the documentation of this project.

This project focuses on the multi-label classification of academic articles using GNNs and label-guided embeddings aimed
at
mitigating the performance decrease resulting from strongly imbalanced labels.

The documentation will cover the different aspects of the project, namely:

- [Setting up the project](project_installation.md)
- [Creating the right settings](settings.md)
- [Preparing the data](preparing_data.md)
- [Training a model](training.md)
- [Optimising a model](optimization.md)
