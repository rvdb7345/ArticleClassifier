    "The data presented in this EDA is from Elsevier and is named Canary. The dataset is a subset of the Embase database. The Embase database is a biomedical research database maintained by the published Elsevier. The datbase is indexed by Emtree indexing terms, Elsevierâ€™s authoritative life science thesaurus. The dataset contains the abstracts, keywords, titles and some supplemental information about articles present in this database in combination with the Emtree terms that are linked in to articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the Emtree terms are the labels that we want to assign to the papers. The Emtree terms are polyhierarchical, meaning that we have multiple tree structures that link the terms, while terms can still occur in two (or more) hierarchies at the same time. The Emtree terms index the entire text and pose a multilabel classification problem where the labels are not independent."

    "**Present here the results of your exploratory data analysis. Note that there is no need to have a \"story line\" - it is more important that you show your understanding of the data and the methods that you will be using in your experiments (i.e. your methodology).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As an example, you could show data, label, or group balances, skewness, and basic characterizations of the data. Information about data frequency and distributions as well as results from reduction mechanisms such as PCA could be useful. Furthermore, indicate outliers and how/why you are taking them out of your samples, if you do so.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The idea is, that you conduct this analysis to a) understand the data better but b) also to verify the shapes of the distributions and whether they meet the assumptions of the methods that you will attempt to use. Finally, make good use of images, diagrams, and tables to showcase what information you have extracted from your data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, you are in a jupyter notebook environment here. This means that you should focus little on writing text and more on actually exploring your data. If you need to, you can use the amsmath environment in-line: $e=mc^2$ or also in separate equations such as here:\n",
